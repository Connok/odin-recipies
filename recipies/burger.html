        <h2>Discription</h2>
        <p>I know you know how to make a cheeseburger ‚Ä¶ but as it turns out, I have some tips you might find useful! From the best beef to the best bun to the best cheese, today‚Äôs burger recipe also comes with your choice of burger sauces: a tomato one or my quick creamy Special Burger Sauce. Plus, homemade fries!

            The only questions left are really, single or double cheeseburger?? Stove or BBQ??</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Forming</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Separate the beef into 4 mounds, or 8 if making double cheeseburgers. Gently roll each mound into a ball (not firmly, we want tender patties not rock hard ones!) then press down into a patty that is slightly wider than the burger bun, to factor in cooking shrinkage.

                As noted above, I like using buns that are maximum 10 cm / 4‚Ä≥ wide so the patty is proportionally a good size and thickness. If your buns are much larger, I‚Äôd recommend using more beef else you‚Äôll end up with wafer-thin patties, or patties that are way smaller than your buns!</li>
            <li>Thinning the centre of the patty compensates for the tendency of the patty to dome up in the middle as it cooks. It also reduces the overall patty shrinkage during cooking. Doing this means there‚Äôs no need to squash the burger to keep it flat and even as it cooks (losing precious juices!) Use your fingers or the back of your hand to press a dent into the centre of the patty. A neat trick I picked up from Bobby Flay many years ago!</li>
            <li>Here‚Äôs what it looks like. It doesn‚Äôt need to be even or deep, just a slight inwards curve, so the patty is shaped a bit like a red blood cell.</li>
            <li>My second key tip is to only salt the patty just before cooking. If you salt your patty ahead of time and leave it sitting around, the cooked patty ends up much firmer. This is because the salt acts on the meat proteins and changes their chemistry. Go ahead and give it a go, if you want to see it for yourself! üôÇ I salt mine while the skillet is pre-heating.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>

            <h3>Cooking the Patties</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Preheat oil in a heavy-based cast iron skillet over high heat until it is very, very hot. Why a cast-iron skillet? Because it‚Äôs made for high heat fast cooking so we can get a great caramelised dark brown crust without overcooking the inside. This burger patty cooks in 3 minutes flat!</li>
            <li>Place 2 or 4 patties in the skillet (depending how many fit) and cook the first side for 1 1/2 minutes, pressing down LIGHTLY with a spatula. Note the emphasis on ‚Äúlightly‚Äù! Nobody likes dense, hard patties where all the juice has been squeezed out during the cooking phase!</li>
            <li>
                Flip the burgers then immediately top with cheese and cook for another 1 1/2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>And look at that. A perfectly cooked patty and melted cheese draped over it. A flawless burger!</li>
